    "What is longitudinal data?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Repeated responses over time on independent units (subjects)\n",
    "\n",
    "A longitudinal study then refers to situations where the outcome and in some cases treatments are collected at multiple follow-up times.\n",
    "\n",
    "These kind of studies typically result in two types of outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Times of key events (e.g. recovery, death)\n",
    "- Repeated values of markers of the status of the participant\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of longitudinal studies:\n",
    "1. Incident events are recorded\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Measure the new occurrence of disease.\n",
    "    - Timing of disease onset can be correlated with recent changes in patient exposure and/or with chronic exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Prospective ascertainment of exposure\n",
    "    - Participants can have their exposure status recorded at multiple follow-up visits. This can alleviate recall bias.\n",
    "    - Temporal order of exposures and outcomes is observed\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Measurement of individual change in outcomes\n",
    "    - A key strength of a longitudinal study is the ability to measure change in outcomes and/or exposure at the individual level.\n",
    "    - Longitudinal studies provide the opportunity to observe individual patterns of change.\n",
    "4. Separation of time effects: Cohort, Period, Age\n",
    "    - When studying change over time there are many time scales to consider.\n",
    "        - cohort scale is the time of birth such as 1945 or 1963.\n",
    "        - period is the current time such as 2004.\n",
    "        - age is (period - cohort).\n",
    "    - A longitudinal study with times t1, t2, . . . tn can characterize multiple time scales such as age and cohort effects using covariates derived from the calendar time and birth year: age of subject $i$ at time $t_j$ is $age_{ij}$ = ($t_j âˆ’ birth_i$); and cohort is $cohort_{ij} = birth_i$\n",
